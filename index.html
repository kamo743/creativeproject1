			<h1 style="display: inline;">O</h1><p style="display: inline;">nce upon a time, about three years after George Washington left the presidency and also in the middle of winter, George was checkin’ on the trees around his estate.</p>
			<p style="display: block";></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime2" class="button">SO FAR SO GOOD</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime2" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">H</h1><p style="display: inline;">e came back inside and complained about his new sore throat. His wife, Martha, was concerned but George just laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed. He sat down and began to read the paper while Martha tried to give him some medicine. George turned down her offers and continued to read his pape’s.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime3" class="button">SO FAR SO GOOD</a>

		<div id="onceUponATime3" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">H</h1><p style="display: inline;">e said, “You know I never take anything for a cold. Let it go as it came."</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>

			<a href="#onceUponATime4" class="button">SO FAR SO GOOD</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime4" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">A</h1><p style="display: inline;">t two o’clock the next morning, George woke up and was having a hard time breathing. He refused to let Martha call for the groundskeeper or even the maid, scared that he might make them sick as well. And so they waited for about three hours until the maid came to light the fire and then they finally called for Mr. Rawlins, the grounds keeper, who had some experience with bloodletting.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime5" class="button">A COLD?</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime5" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">M</h1><p style="display: inline;">r. Rawlins then attempted various herbs and remedies. When none of them worked, Rawlins began the bloodletting process. He took out 12-14 ounces of blood and then George insisted that he take out even more.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime6" class="button">WHY YOU DOIN ALL THIS FOR A COLD DOCTOR??</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime6" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">A</h1><p style="display: inline;">nother doctor was called for named Dr. Craik. He arrived, got the report on what had already been tried and then administered a poison, that can be healing in small doses, called “Blister of Cantharides” to no avail. He then administered a blood letting of 18 ounces.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime7" class="button">DR. CRAIK WHY DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime7" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">A</h1><p style="display: inline;">nother 18 ounce bloodletting was administered and attempts at gargling sage tea, mixed with vinegar was unsuccessful. George was still strong enough to walk around and did so hoping that movement would help alleviate the pain.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime8" class="button">OH NO STOP PLEASE</a>
		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime8" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">D</h1><p style="display: inline;">r. Craik then called for another blood letting. 32 ounces this time. George had now lost over 40% of his entire natural blood supply. After this George began to feel a little better and was able to go over his last will and testament with Martha.</p>

		</div>

		<div id="onceUponATime9" class="nav">
			<h1 style="display: inline;">M</h1><p style="display: inline;">ore medicines were administered as the night wore on but at 10pm, George Washington muttered some things about how he wanted to be buried and at the age of 67, his hand dropped to his side.</p>
			<p style="display: block" ;></p>
			<br />
			<a href="#onceUponATime10" class="button">Oh so sad so sad. Oh it's so sad...</a>

				nd that’s how it happened. George Washington himself. Killed by doctors after getting a common cold. (To be fair he was like super old for the time period)
				<br />
				<br />
				For the longest time, medical professionals railed on the amount of blood they took out of George Washington but these days, historians opinions have changed to “Well they tried their best with what they had”
